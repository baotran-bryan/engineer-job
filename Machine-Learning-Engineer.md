# Description
**Expected Role**

The Machine Learning Engineer will develop models in machine learning and data science, and build, maintain, and operate the infrastructure to continuously deliver these models to the service. The successful candidate will be expected to develop highly accurate modeling techniques that can leverage CADDi's data and provide value to our products, as well as develop stable systems in a team environment.

**Responsibility:**
- Train, evaluate, and deploy sophisticated machine learning models to enhance the features of our drawing searching system.
- Participate in the full software development cycle: design, develop, QA, deploy, experiment, analyze and iterate
- Collaborate across disciplines and with other ML teams to find technical solutions to solve complex challenges
- Monitor and continuously improve the deployed models.

**Examples of what success looks like in this role:**
- Analyze drawing images and develop technology to extract information described on the drawings.
- Construct image recognition models and annotation system
- Study the use of large-scale language models (LLM) and large-scale visual models (LVM).
- Collaborate with data science teams to bring prototype models to production
- Raise the bar for engineering excellence and delivery

**Interest and experience gained from this position:**
- Experience in challenging highly difficult technical issues with highly enthusiastic members.
- Experience working with members with expertise in a wide range of areas, including software as well as machine learning.
- Experience in solving problems by taking into account how to develop the value of technology as a business.
- The position is close to MLOps and product management members, so you will be able to expand your work depending on your will.
